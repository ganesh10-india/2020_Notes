    "Batch normalization seeks to stabilize the distribution of inputs to a given network layer during training.The batch norm layer sets the first two moments of the distribution of each activation to zero and one respectively, (mean and variance) Then BN inputs are scaled by trainable parameters. BN is applied pre activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal covariate shift - distribution of input to a layer changes due to an update of a parameter of an earlier layer. This change is believed to constantly change the training problem as parameters are updated. Networks with BN have been tested and do not significantly reduce ICS compared to networks wout BN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch Norm smooths the loss function. The loss changes at a smaller rate with smaller magnitude of gradients as well. With a smoother loss surface, larger step size can be used wihich leads to faster convergence. \n",

    "\n",
    "__Tips__\n",
    "- Batch normalization doesn't work as well when the batch size is small. This can become an issue when processing high resolution images that stretch your training system's memory limit\n",
    "- the link between batch norm and reducing internal covariate shift is [tenuous](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11604.pdf)\n"
