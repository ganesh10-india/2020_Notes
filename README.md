# 2019_Notes

This repository contains various scripts, jupyter notebooks, and other notes on topics that I find interesting. At the moment, they are NOT useful as an educational resource.
In the future, I plan on including a detailed list of the most useful learning path that I found. I am currently focusing most of my efforts on learning reinforcement learning methods.
