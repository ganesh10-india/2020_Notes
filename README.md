# 2019_Notes

This repository contains various scripts, jupyter notebooks, and other notes on topics that I find interesting. At the moment, this repository is NOT useful as an educational resource.

In the future, I plan on including a detailed list of the most useful learning path that I find. I am currently focusing most of my efforts on learning reinforcement learning methods.
