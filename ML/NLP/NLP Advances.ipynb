    "\n",
    "For a long time, we used pre-trained word embeddings such as word2vec or GloVe to initialize the first layer of a neural network, followed by a task-specific architecture that is trained in a supervised way using a single dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, several works demonstrated that we can learn hierarchical contextualized representations on web-scale datasets üìñ leveraging unsupervised (or self-supervised) signals such as language modeling and transfer this pre-training to downstream tasks (Transfer Learning)\n",
